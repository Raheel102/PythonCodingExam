# PythonCodingExam


I didn't have too much issues with the exam outside of the Database Design.
The instructions were kinda vague and i wasn't entirely sure what they wanted and 
I was torn between making a schema and a ER Diagram but ultimately went with 
a schema as an ER Diagram seemed too high level for this situation.
I did use this product (https://www.pvcfittingsonline.com/854-010-1-schedule-80-pvc-van-stone-flanges.html#)

I also wasn't 100% sure if you wanted to repeat the 200 TODO List after each sub task
but I included that in the code also.
